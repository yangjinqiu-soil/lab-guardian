# lab-guardian
A lightweight desktop agent that tracks user activity and gently reminds you to refocus when research work pauses.if no keyboard or mouse input occurs for a set time, a small transparent overlay appears to encourage you to resume work.  It runs entirely locally and never records screen content, captures screenshots, or uploads data.
